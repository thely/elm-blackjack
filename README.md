### Blackjack in Elm!

To test this, copy the full text of `Blackjack.elm` in the [online compiler](http://elm-lang.org/try). Remove the `module Blackjack where` line, as the online compiler will throw an error. 

Alternatively, [install the Elm platform](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm) and download `Blackjack.elm`. On the command line, navigate to wherever the file was saved, and run `elm-reactor` from that folder. In a browser, go to `localhost:8000` and click on the filename (not the wrench). You won't need to remove the `module` line if you run it through `elm-reactor`.

Note: this project uses Elm v0.14
